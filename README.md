## What makes this different

Most LinkedIn job scrapers dump raw title and description. This one computes the fields buyers actually want:

1. **Parsed salary range** on every job row. Currency, period (annual, monthly, weekly, daily, hourly), min, and max. Extracted from description text with sanity checks so "$50 gift card" does not pollute your dataset. Zero post processing.
2. **Tech stack extraction** on every engineering job. 120+ terms across languages, frameworks, cloud services, data stores, ML libraries, and dev tools. Returns a sorted deduped lowercase array. Built in. No extra cost.
3. **Seniority tier from title.** Maps messy LinkedIn titles to one of ten buckets (intern, entry, mid, senior, staff, lead, manager, director, vp, c-suite) so you can rank roles across companies without cleaning strings yourself.

## How it works

```
flowchart LR
    A[Keywords + locations] --> B[LinkedIn guest search<br/>/jobs-guest/api/seeMoreJobPostings]
    B --> C[Collect job IDs<br/>paginate]
    C --> D[Open each job detail<br/>/jobs-guest/api/jobPosting]
    D --> E[Parse title, company,<br/>description, criteria]
    E --> F[Compute salary, tech stack,<br/>seniority, remote type]
    F --> G[Push one row per job]
    G --> H[(JSON, CSV, Excel, API)]
```

No cookies, no login, no Sales Navigator seat. The actor hits LinkedIn's public guest endpoints the same way Google does when indexing jobs.

## Quick start

**Track new hiring at FAANG for the last week:**

  "keywords": ["software engineer", "product manager", "data scientist"],
  "locations": ["San Francisco Bay Area", "New York", "Seattle"],
  "postedSince": "1w",

  "parseSalary": true,
  "maxResults": 200
}
```

**Remote only filter for agency sourcing:**

```

  "remoteFilter": "remote",
  "postedSince": "1w",
  "maxResults": 100

## FAQ

**Is there a free LinkedIn jobs API?**
LinkedIn's Talent API is gated behind a partner agreement and a per seat contract. This actor gives anyone public LinkedIn job data with pay per use and no approval needed.

**Do I need a LinkedIn account or cookie?**
No. The actor uses LinkedIn's public guest endpoints, the same ones Google uses when indexing jobs.

**How accurate is the salary parser?**
High precision on jobs that publish a range in the description (mandatory under California, New York, Washington, and Colorado pay transparency laws). Handles USD, EUR, GBP, CAD, AUD, INR, and CHF. Plausibility checks reject outliers so small dollar amounts in the description do not get mistaken for pay. Jobs without a published range return `salaryMin: null`.

**How does the tech stack extractor work?**
A curated list of 120+ languages, frameworks, cloud services, data stores, ML libraries, and dev tools is scanned against the description with strict word boundary matching. C++ and C# are handled correctly. False positives from English words (go, rest, r) are filtered out.

**How accurate is seniority classification?**
Title based. Senior, staff, principal, lead, manager, director, vp, chief, and intern patterns are recognized. Default bucket is mid. This is meant as a fast normalizer across noisy LinkedIn labels, not a legal determination.

**Why is `salaryMin` null on some rows?**
Either the description did not publish a range, the range fell outside plausibility checks, or the job is in a jurisdiction with no pay transparency law. Turn on `parseSalary` and inspect `descriptionLength` to confirm.

**Can I paginate past 1000 results?**
LinkedIn's guest search caps at about 1000 jobs per query. Split your search into narrower filters (per city instead of per country, per experience level) to reach more jobs.

**Does it work for LinkedIn jobs in any country?**
Yes. Pass the location as LinkedIn spells it in its location dropdown. The actor ships with residential proxy rotation so your results reflect what a signed out visitor sees.

**Is scraping LinkedIn allowed?**
This actor reads public HTML any web visitor can see. Respect LinkedIn's terms and rate limit sensibly. Do not redistribute descriptions or company data you do not have the right to republish.

**Can I run this on a schedule?**
Yes. Use the Apify scheduler for hourly, daily, or weekly runs. Turn `dedupe` on to only push new job IDs. Great for competitor hiring watch and alerting.
